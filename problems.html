<h2>A selection of typical CSP problems</h2>

<h3>Knights problem</h3>

How can a knight jump on an NxN chessboard in such a way that it visits every square exactly once? Consider two cases:
<ol>
<li>The knight's tour ends on the same square where it begun
<li>The knight's tour ends on a dfferent square
</ol>

<h3>Cryptarithmetics</h3>

<ol>
<li>SEND + MORE = MONEY
<li>TWO + TWO = FOUR
</ol>

<h3>Einstein zebra problem (three houses)</h3>

<ol>
<li>There are three houses, three nationals, three animals, three cigarettes.
<li>The Englishman lives in the first house on the left.
<li>In the house immediately on the right of that housing the wolf, they smoke Luky Strike.
<li>The Spaniard smokes Kent.
<li>The Russian has a horse.
</ol> 
Who smokes LM? Who has the dog?

<h3>Einstein zebra problem (five houses)</h3>

</ol>
Who drinks water? Who owns the zebra?

<h3>Maps colouring problem</h3>

Is there a way to color a map using N colors such that no adjacent 
countries do have the same color? Fnd such a map coloring.

<h3>Crosswords</h3>

Read an empty crosswords square (i.e. an MxN square and the positions of the black cells). And read
a dictionary of words. Fill the crosswords square, such that all words formed on lines and columns appear
in the dictionary.

<h3>Magic square</h3>

Fill an NxN square with all numbers from 1 to N^2 such that
the sum of all elements on any line, any column and any diagonal
are all the same.

<h3>Sudoku</h3>

Solve a sudoku game.
<ol>
<li>A 9x9 board, divided in 9 quares of 3x3.
<li>Each cell has a number from 1 to 9.
<li>Any line has all numbers exactly once.
<li>Any column has all numbers exactly once.
<li>Any square has all numbers exactly once.
</ol>
The board is read partially filled. It has to be filled completely.

<h3>Timetable</h3>

The following items are available:
<ul>
<li>A list of classes;
<li>A list of classrooms;
<li>A list of tutors, and the list of subjects they can teach;
<li>Lists of subjects to be taught to classes;
</ul>

Decide on the classes timetable (i.e. who teaches what, when, where and to whom).

<h3>Car sequencing</h3>

The car sequencing problem involves scheduling the assembly of cars which are distinguished into classes by
different sets of options. The assembly line has different stations where the various options (air-conditioning,
sun-roof, radio) are installed by teams. Each such station has a certain workload capacity given by the
parameters M and N, denoting M out of a sequence of N cars can be fitted the given option. The objective 
is to produce such a sequence of cars that (i) the demand for each car class is satisfied and (ii) none 
of the capacity constraints is violated.

<h3>Job-shop scheduling</h3>

The following are given:
<ul>
<li>A finite set of n jobs
<li>Each job i consists of a chain of n_i operations 
<li>A finite set of m machines
<li>Each machine can handle at most one operation at a time
<li>Each operation needs to be processed during an uninterrupted period of a given length on a given machine
</ul>
The purpose is to find a schedule, that is, an allocation of the operations to time intervals to machines, that has minimal length

<h3>Balanced Academic Curriculum</h3>

Design a balanced academic curriculum by assigning periods to courses in a way that the academic load of each period is balanced, i.e., as similar as possible. The curriculum must obey the following administrative and academic regulations:

<ol>
<li>Academic curriculum: an academic curriculum is defined by a set of courses and a set of prerequisite relationships among them.
<li>Number of periods: courses must be assigned within a maximum number of academic periods.
<li>Academic load: each course has associated a number of credits or units that represent the academic effort required to successfully follow it.
<li>Prerequisites: some courses can have other courses as prerequisites.
<li>Minimum academic load: a minimum amount of academic credits per period is required to consider a student as full time.
<li>Maximum academic load: a maximum amount of academic credits per period is allowed in order to avoid overload.
<li>Minimum number of courses: a minimum number of courses per period is required to consider a student as full time.
<li>Maximum number of courses: a maximum number of courses per period is allowed in order to avoid overload.
</ol>

The goal is to assign a period to every course in a way that the minimum and maximum academic load for each period, the minimum and maximum number of courses for each period, and the prerequisite relationships are satisfied. An optimal balanced curriculum minimises the maximum academic load for all periods. Note that we could consider other types of balance criterion such as minimising the sum of the academic load of all periods. 

<h3>Dinosaur Mystery</h3>

<p>Skeletons of Eucentrosaurus, 
  Hadrosaurus, Herrerasaurus, Megasaurus, and Nuoerosaurus have been found in 
  Argentina, Canada, China, England, and the U.S. None of these dinosaurs has 
  been found in more than one of these countries. The dinosaur from China is the 
  largest of the bunch, Herrerasaurus was the smallest, and Megasaurus was larger 
  than Hadrosaurus or Eucentrosaurus. The dinosaurs from China and North America 
  were plant-eaters but Megasaurus ate meat. Eucentrosaurus lived in North America. 
  The dinosaurs from North America and England lived later than Herrerasaurus. 
  Hadrosaurus lived in Argentina or the U.S. Which dinosaur lived in which country?</p>

<h3>Making Widgets</h3>

<p>To make a widget using a 
  widget-maker, you must put a metal blank in the slot, push the button, turn 
  the crank, pull the lever, and turn the key, but these actions must be done 
  in a certain order. The first thing you do is either pull the lever or turn 
  the key. You can't put the blank in the slot until after you push the button 
  and turn the crank, and you have to do something after you put in the blank. 
  The key won't turn when there is no blank in the slot. You must push the button 
  immediately after you pull the lever. How do you make a widget?</p>

<h3>Scheduling Problem</h3>

<p>Classes are offered periods 
  1-8 with 1-4 in the morning and 5-8 in the afternoon. </p>
<p>You need three classes on 
  Monday and you can use MATH, CHEM, PHIL, or HIST. CHEM is offered odd periods 
  and MATH is offered all periods. HIST is offered periods 2 and 4. PHIL is offered 
  periods 5 and 7. </p>
<p>CHEM and MATH are taught 
  on south campus. HIST and PHIL are taught on north campus. You can't schedule 
  back-to-back classes on opposite ends of campus</p>

<p>You have to work mornings 
  or afternoons and you don't want a first period class. Can you satisfy all these 
  constraints? If so, do you tell your boss you will work in the mornings or in 
  the afternoons?</p>

<h3>The Train</h3>

<p>On a certain train, the 
  crew consists of the brakeman, the fireman, and the engineer. Their names in 
  alphabetical order are Jones, Robinson, and Smith. On the train are also three 
  passengers with corresponding names. Mr. Robinson lives in Detroit. The brakeman 
  lives halfway between Detroit and Chicago. Mr. Jones earns exactly $20,000 a 
  year. Smith once beat the fireman at billiards. The brakeman's next-door neighbor, 
  one of the passengers, earns exactly three times as much as the brakeman. The 
  passenger living in Chicago has the same name as the brakeman. What is the engineer's 
  name?<br>
